\begin_layout Title
Advanced instrumentation strategy and test matrix selection for turbines
 case
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ability to design instrumentation of any type of experiment is crucial to
 cost, effectiveness and robustness of the experimental setup.
 Growing computational power allows to predict phenomenon that is being
 measured.
 Obtained information can be used to perform optimization and design an
 experiment that will reduce measurement errors.
 The main subject of this work was to find formal procedure, that will 
\shape italic
a priori
\shape default
 provide instrumentation guidelines, like where to measure pressure on an
 airfoil.
 The proposed optimization algorithm is based on statistical criterion called
 
\shape italic
A-criterion
\shape default
, which is constructed from surrogate model obtained from Proper Orthogonal
 Decomposition (POD) of set of numerical results.
 Additionally, thanks to proposed approach, collected data from an experiment
 together with numerical results allows to reconstruct all flow fields in
 computational domain.
 Numerical tests have shown that reconstruction gives best approximation
 of pressure profile in comparison to other approaches.

Presented method was validated using virtual experiment.
 The experiment consisted of results from numerical simulation based on
 high and low density meshes.
 High density mesh was used as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 experimental data, and coarse mesh was used for measurement locations optimizat
ion.
 The goal was to reconstruct pressure profile in the best possible way from
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 data applied to the sensors positions.
 The results obtained from optimal positions were then compared with a profile
 reconstructed from equally distributed points along the profile.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming, that some observed phenomenon is described by following linear
 model:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V=W\beta+\mu
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 is coefficients matrix, 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 
\series default
is an unknown parameters vector (in general matrix) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 is the difference between linear model (
\begin_inset Formula $W\beta$
\end_inset

) and observations 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 (e.
 g.: measured values during an experiment).
 When least square method is applied to find parameters estimator then it
 can be shown, that covariance of this estimator is equal to
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
cov(\hat{\beta})=(WW^{T})^{-1}
\]

\end_inset

The A-criterion optimization in this case can be formulated as choosing
 coefficients of matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 so that trace of covariance matrix is minimized 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
min\,\,tr((WW^{T})^{-1})
\]

\end_inset

The coefficients of 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 depends directly on the way how linear model is being constructed.
 Therefore the linear model should be built based on sensors positions and
 thus allow to perform optimization using A-criterion.
 For this purpose was used POD decomposition from set of previously calculated
 numerical results.
 This method allows to build the 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $W$

\series default
 matrix as set of orthogonal basis vectors.
 POD is a generic method and thus proposed algorithm is not problem specific.
 Furthermore POD vectors due to its orthogonality ensures numerical stability
 of the optimization algorithm.
 POD decomposition allows to write solution for each numerical mesh node
 and flow variable as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V_{i}=\sum_{j=0}^{N}W_{i,j}\cdot\beta_{j}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{:,j}$
\end_inset

 is one orthogonal vector (one column from
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is coefficients matrix.
 The nature of POD decomposition allows to reduce number of modes used in
 above equation to properly represent solution 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefor the number of coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{j}$
\end_inset

 can also be reduced.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(W_{:,m}W_{:,m}^{T})^{-1}
\]
