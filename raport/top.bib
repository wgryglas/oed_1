	abstract = {We present an efficient method for computing A-optimal experimental designs for infinite-dimensional Bayesian linear inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Specifically, we address the problem of optimizing the location of sensors (at which observational data are collected) to minimize the uncertainty in the parameters estimated by solving the inverse problem, where the uncertainty is expressed by the trace of the posterior covariance. Computing optimal experimental designs (OEDs) is particularly challenging for inverse problems governed by computationally expensive PDE models with infinite-dimensional (or, after discretization, high-dimensional) parameters.  To alleviate the computational cost, we exploit the problem structure and build a low-rank approximation of the parameter-to-observable map, preconditioned with the square root of the prior covariance operator. The availability of this low-rank surrogate, relieves our method from expensive PDE solves when evaluating the optimal experimental design objective function, i.e., the trace of the posterior covariance, and its derivatives. Moreover, we employ a randomized trace estimator for efficient evaluation of the OED objective function.  We control the sparsity of the sensor configuration by employing a sequence of penalty functions that successively approximate the \${\textbackslash}ell\_0\$-``norm''; this results in binary designs that characterize optimal sensor locations. We present numerical results for inference of the initial condition from spatiotemporal observations in a time-dependent advection-diffusion problem in two and three space dimensions. We find that an optimal design can be computed at a cost, measured in number of forward PDE solves, that is independent of the parameter and sensor dimensions. Moreover, the numerical optimization problem for finding the optimal design can be solved in a number of interior-point quasi-Newton iterations that is insensitive to the parameter and sensor dimensions. We demonstrate numerically that \${\textbackslash}ell\_0\$-sparsified experimental designs obtained via a continuation method outperform \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$-sparsified designs.},

	isbn = {9781107008250},
	abstract = {Turbulence pervades our world, from weather patterns to the air entering our lungs. This book describes methods that reveal its structures and dynamics. Building on the existence of coherent structures - recurrent patterns - in turbulent flows, it describes mathematical methods that reduce the governing (Navier-Stokes) equations to simpler forms that can be understood more easily. This second edition contains a new chapter on the balanced proper orthogonal decomposition: a method derived from control theory that is especially useful for flows equipped with sensors and actuators. It also reviews relevant work carried out since 1995. The book is ideal for engineering, physical science and mathematics researchers working in fluid dynamics and other areas in which coherent patterns emerge.},

	abstract = {For dynamic distributed systems modeled by partial differential equations, existing methods of sensor location in parameter estimation experiments are either limited to one-dimensional spatial domains or require large investments in software systems. With the expense of scanning and moving sensors, optimal placement presents a critical problem.Optimal Measurement Methods for Distributed Parameter System Identification discusses the characteristic features of the sensor placement problem, analyzes classical and recent approaches, and proposes a wide range of original solutions, culminating in the most comprehensive and timely treatment of the issue available. By presenting a step-by-step guide to theoretical aspects and to practical design methods, this book provides a sound understanding of sensor location techniques.Both researchers and practitioners will find the case studies, the proposed algorithms, and the numerical examples to be invaluable. This text also offers results that translate easily to MATLAB and to Maple. Assuming only a basic familiarity with partial differential equations, vector spaces, and probability and statistics, and avoiding too many technicalities, this is a superb resource for researchers and practitioners in the fields of applied mathematics, electrical, civil, geotechnical, mechanical, chemical, and environmental engineering.},

	abstract = {The subject of inverse problems in differential equations is of enormous practical importance, and has also generated substantial mathematical and computational innovation. Typically some form of regularization is required to ameliorate ill-posed behaviour. In this article we review the Bayesian approach to regularization, developing a function space viewpoint on the subject. This approach allows for a full characterization of all possible solutions, and their relative probabilities, whilst simultaneously forcing significant modelling issues to be addressed in a clear and precise fashion. Although expensive to implement, this approach is starting to lie within the range of the available computational resources in many application areas. It also allows for the quantification of uncertainty and risk, something which is increasingly demanded by these applications. Furthermore, the approach is conceptually important for the understanding of simpler, computationally expedient approaches to inverse problems.},

	abstract = {The optimal selection of experimental conditions is essential to maximizing the value of data for inference and prediction, particularly in situations where experiments are time-consuming and expensive to conduct. We propose a general mathematical framework and an algorithmic approach for optimal experimental design with nonlinear simulation-based models; in particular, we focus on finding sets of experiments that provide the most information about targeted sets of parameters. Our framework employs a Bayesian statistical setting, which provides a foundation for inference from noisy, indirect, and incomplete data, and a natural mechanism for incorporating heterogeneous sources of information. An objective function is constructed from information theoretic measures, reflecting expected information gain from proposed combinations of experiments. Polynomial chaos approximations and a two-stage Monte Carlo sampling method are used to evaluate the expected information gain. Stochastic approximation algorithms are then used to make optimization feasible in computationally intensive and high-dimensional settings. These algorithms are demonstrated on model problems and on nonlinear parameter estimation problems arising in detailed combustion kinetics.},
