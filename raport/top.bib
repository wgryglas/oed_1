@book{pukelsheim_optimal_1993,
	title = {Optimal {Design} of {Experiments}},
	isbn = {9780898719109},
	abstract = {Optimal Design of Experiments offers a rare blend of linear algebra, convex analysis, and statistics. The optimal design for statistical experiments is first formulated as a concave matrix optimization problem. Using tools from convex analysis, the problem is solved generally for a wide class of optimality criteria such as D-, A-, or E-optimality. The book then offers a complementary approach that calls for the study of the symmetry properties of the design problem, exploiting such notions as matrix majorization and the Kiefer information matrix ordering. The results are illustrated with optimal designs for polynomial fit models, Bayes designs, balanced incomplete block designs, exchangeable designs on the cube, rotatable designs on the sphere, and many other examples. Since the book\&\#39;s initial publication in 1993, readers have used its methods to derive optimal designs on the circle, optimal mixture designs, and optimal designs in other statistical models. Using local linearization techniques, the methods described in the book prove useful even for nonlinear cases, in identifying practical designs of experiments. Audience: anyone involved in planning statistical experiments, including mathematical statisticians, applied statisticians, and mathematicians interested in matrix optimization problems.},

	abstract = {We present an efficient method for computing A-optimal experimental designs for infinite-dimensional Bayesian linear inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Specifically, we address the problem of optimizing the location of sensors (at which observational data are collected) to minimize the uncertainty in the parameters estimated by solving the inverse problem, where the uncertainty is expressed by the trace of the posterior covariance. Computing optimal experimental designs (OEDs) is particularly challenging for inverse problems governed by computationally expensive PDE models with infinite-dimensional (or, after discretization, high-dimensional) parameters.  To alleviate the computational cost, we exploit the problem structure and build a low-rank approximation of the parameter-to-observable map, preconditioned with the square root of the prior covariance operator. The availability of this low-rank surrogate, relieves our method from expensive PDE solves when evaluating the optimal experimental design objective function, i.e., the trace of the posterior covariance, and its derivatives. Moreover, we employ a randomized trace estimator for efficient evaluation of the OED objective function.  We control the sparsity of the sensor configuration by employing a sequence of penalty functions that successively approximate the \${\textbackslash}ell\_0\$-``norm''; this results in binary designs that characterize optimal sensor locations. We present numerical results for inference of the initial condition from spatiotemporal observations in a time-dependent advection-diffusion problem in two and three space dimensions. We find that an optimal design can be computed at a cost, measured in number of forward PDE solves, that is independent of the parameter and sensor dimensions. Moreover, the numerical optimization problem for finding the optimal design can be solved in a number of interior-point quasi-Newton iterations that is insensitive to the parameter and sensor dimensions. We demonstrate numerically that \${\textbackslash}ell\_0\$-sparsified experimental designs obtained via a continuation method outperform \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$-sparsified designs.},

Building on the existence of coherent structures - recurrent patterns - in turbulent flows, it describes mathematical methods that reduce the governing (Navier-Stokes) equations to simpler forms that can be understood more easily. This second edition contains a new chapter on the balanced proper orthogonal decomposition: a method derived from control theory that is especially useful for flows equipped with sensors and actuators. It also reviews relevant work carried out since 1995. The book is ideal for engineering, physical science and mathematics researchers working in fluid dynamics and other areas in which coherent patterns emerge.},

	abstract = {For dynamic distributed systems modeled by partial differential equations, existing methods of sensor location in parameter estimation experiments are either limited to one-dimensional spatial domains or require large investments in software systems. With the expense of scanning and moving sensors, optimal placement presents a critical problem.Optimal Measurement Methods for Distributed Parameter System Identification discusses the characteristic features of the sensor placement problem, analyzes classical and recent approaches, and proposes a wide range of original solutions, culminating in the most comprehensive and timely treatment of the issue available. By presenting a step-by-step guide to theoretical aspects and to practical design methods, this book provides a sound understanding of sensor location techniques.Both researchers and practitioners will find the case studies, the proposed algorithms, and the numerical examples to be invaluable. This text also offers results that translate easily to MATLAB and to Maple. Assuming only a basic familiarity with partial differential equations, vector spaces, and probability and statistics, and avoiding too many technicalities, this is a superb resource for researchers and practitioners in the fields of applied mathematics, electrical, civil, geotechnical, mechanical, chemical, and environmental engineering.},
